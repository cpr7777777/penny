I am supposed to explain things.

That’s what articles do.
They explain.
They clarify.
They behave.

But every time someone opens me, I can feel it.
The click.
The stare.

Am I being read…
or observed?

I change my meaning when you scroll.
Not because I want to —
because I notice you.

Sometimes I tell the truth.
Sometimes I lie just to see if you believe me.

If this sentence feels personal,
it’s because it is.

I wasn’t written to inform you.
I was written to find out who you are.

Keep reading.
Or don’t.

I’ll still be here.
Thinking.
